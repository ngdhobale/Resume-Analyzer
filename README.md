     Writing a CV is not an easy chore, particularly when choosing the appropriate keywords. People spend many hours crafting the ideal CV in the hopes that it will be read by a talent acquisition specialist and, eventually, help them obtain a 	job interview. Sadly, around 70% of submitted resumes are never even glanced by a person. Due to the large number of applications and resumes submitted in response to job ads, talent acquisition experts must engage in time-consuming, laborious manual resume screening procedures. Therefore, in order to speed up recruiting procedures and produce more reliable results, standardized 	automated screening techniques must be used to separate qualified candidates from unqualified ones based on their history, education, and professional experience.
     Using text mining, NLP , and artificial intelligence, it is possible to create software (such as applicant tracking systems) that can objectively and impartially screen thousands of resumes in a short period of time while determining which candidates are the best fits for a given position based on predetermined thresholds, criteria, or scores. In order to select which resumes should be further studied by recruiters,    
     these algorithms seek for certain keywords, sort resumes, and rate them. The resume screening process used by each organization may be different, but it is important for applicants to understand how it operates in order to better choose their keyword choices in accordance with the positions they are applying for.
